# Food-Delivery-Cost-and-Profitability-Analysis
The primary libraries used in this project are:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Dataset
This project uses a dataset that includes information on food delivery costs, order details, and customer behaviors. The dataset is structured as follows:
Order ID: Unique identifier for each food order
Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
Delivery Time: Time taken for each delivery (in minutes)
Delivery Cost: Cost incurred for each delivery (in currency)
Order Value: The total value of each food order
Profit: Profit earned from each order



Features
Cost Analysis: Identifies the key factors driving delivery costs.
Profitability Analysis: Evaluates how costs impact overall profitability.
Customer Segmentation: Segments customers based on order patterns and profitability.
Visualization: Provides data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent cost trends, profit margins, and customer behavior.
Usage
You can run the analysis by executing the Jupyter Notebook (Food_Delivery_Cost_and_Profitability_Analysis.ipynb) in your environment.

Results
This project provides actionable insights on:

Cost Drivers: Major factors contributing to delivery costs.
Profit Maximization: How food delivery services can increase profitability by optimizing order value and minimizing delivery time and costs.
Customer Behavior: Analysis of how different customer segments contribute to profitability.
Some visualizations included:

Cost vs. Delivery Time: A scatter plot to identify the relationship between time and cost.
Profit Distribution: A bar chart to show the distribution of profits across different orders.
Customer Segments: A heatmap for identifying high-value customers.
